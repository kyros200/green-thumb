This is a project created by me, following instructions to reproduce a Figma project.

I wrote all the code in 3 days, and in this README.md file I will explain what I did each day, and what I could do better in this project.

## Intro

The project was meant to be done in plain ***HTML, CSS & JS***, and i couldn't use Frameworks (React, Angular, ...). That was a problem because I'm not used to it, but at the same time it was an interesting opportunity for me to learn a couple of thing in pure JS.

## Day 1 (3h)

* Organized first draft of roadmap (Separated whole project in 3 big parts: Header, Filter & Result)
* finished Header part.

## Day 2 (5h)

* Finished Filter part. Biggest challenge was for custom dropdown.
* Organized files. Now each file is for a specific purpose.

## Day 3

## Final Thoughts

The Challenge was fun to do, but some things did bother me: some color and position inconsistencies. This took me more time than I imagined when developing. Also there is no icon for High sunlight in the folder of images (only on Figma).

The most interesting part for me was doing a custom dropdown from pure JS. That was a blast and I was happy with the result.
